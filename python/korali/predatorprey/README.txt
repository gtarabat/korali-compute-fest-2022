Predator Prey Simulation
================================================================================= 

The evolution of two populations of predator and prey can be modelled with the 
[Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations).

In this example we estimate the parameter of the LV-model with different approaches and solvers.
