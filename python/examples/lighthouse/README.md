The Lighthouse Problem
================================================================================= 
A lighthouse is somewhere off a piece of straight coastline at a position along the shore and a distance out at sea. It emits a series of short highly collimated flashes at random intervals and hence at random azimuths. These pulses are intercepted on the coast by photo-detectors that record only the fact that a flash has occurred, but not the angle from which it came. :A series of flashes have so far been recorded. Where is the lighthouse? - Text taken from [Sivia2006] (Example 3, 2nd Edition).

Setup                                                                           
----------------------------                                                    

Example 1 (distance b from shore known, location a at coastline unknown)
   
```
  ./example_1
  python -m korali.plot --dir _results_example_1                             
```

Example 2 (distance b & location a unknown)            

```                                                                                 
  ./example_2
  python -m korali.plot --dir _results_example_2
```
